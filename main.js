"Statistical Population":
    "recordset" or set of "records"
    similar items or events
    existing || hypothetical objects
    subset of recordset or population
    intension
        represent total population for a particular area of interest

Probability:
    compares to:
        statistical thought process
    Analyzing frequency of past events
    Observation evaluation & explanation
    Associate various individual events
    Events relating to one another:
        governs the rules that will need to be followed when creating methods
False Positives:
    Statistical concept:
        **Very Important
    Mistake || errored result
    "False Alarm"
    Understood by:
        "Considering idea of recordset || statistical population"

Statistical Inference:
    usedTo:

        Inferential statistical analysis
    Testing various hypotheses & deriving estimates
        **Yes! the interesting part of data science || the reason I got interested I should say

Regression:

        determining relationships amoung variables
    Understanding of:
        what a variable is
    VariableTypes:
        Dependent
